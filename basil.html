      <p>
        <b>Details:</b> Basil (Ocimum spp.) is a member of the mint family.
        There are several species and numerous interspecific hybrids. The most
        common culinary type is sweet basil, O. basilicum, which also has purple
        and lemon-scented cultivars. Specialty types include Thai (O.
        tenuiflorum), lemon (O. americanum X O. citridorum) and small-leaved
        bush types of various species and crosses. Basil seed is not always true
        to type. Try to obtain high-quality seed that is uniform with a high
        germination percentage.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Planting Conditions:</b> Basil grows well in a warm, well-drained
        soil in a wide pH range, although the typical vegetable crop range of pH
        6.0-6.8 is ideal. In New England, basil is most commonly transplanted,
        but because it is highly sensitive to cold (low 40s), it should not be
        set out until after danger of frost. Transplants should be 4 to 6 weeks
        old. Basil is often spaced at 6"-12" between plants in double rows.
        Tighter spacing will promote longer shoots for bunching.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Harvesting:</b> Basil can be lightly harvested by pruning as early as
        6 weeks after planting, with regular harvests starting a few weeks after
        that. Harvests should take place in the morning after the dew has left
        the plants. Basil grown for culinary use should be harvested before
        flowering. Flavor will be adversely affected if allowed to flower. If
        grown for essential oil production, it should be harvested at full
        bloom.
